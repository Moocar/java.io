JK7 java.nio.file.Path compatibility for clojure.java.io

## Usage

[java.nio.file.Path](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Path.html) is a new abstraction for File paths that was introduced in JDK7. This library provides compativility between clojure.java.io and Paths.

Example usage below

```clojure
(require 'me.moocar.java.io)
(require '[clojure.java.io :as jio])
(import '(java.nio.file Paths))

(def p (Paths/get "/tmp" (into-array ["foo"])))

(with-open [writer (jio/writer p)]
  (.write writer "Hello!\n"))

(with-open [writer (jio/writer p :append true)]
  (.write writer "How's it goin?\n"))

(with-open [reader (jio/reader p)]
  (println (slurp reader)))
Hello!
How's it goin?

(println (type (jio/as-file p)))
java.io.File
```

A convenience function is also provided to create paths

```clojure
(me.moocar.java.io/path "/tmp/foo")
#<UnixPath /tmp/foo>
(me.moocar.java.io/path "/tmp" "foo" "bar")
#<UnixPath /tmp/foo/bar>
```
